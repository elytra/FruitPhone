*An extra-immersive Waila alternative*

**This mod is open source and under a permissive license.** All Elytra mods are,
and as such, can be included in any modpack on any platform without prior
permission. We appreciate hearing about people using our mods, but you do not
need to ask to use them. See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more details.

Fruit Phone is an implementation of an information renderer for
[ProbeDataProviderAPI](https://github.com/elytra/ProbeDataProviderAPI), and
includes an optional shim to convert Waila information to ProbeData format.

It has a focus on being stylish and requires an item to show information by
default. The items can be disabled entirely in the config, and a gamerule is
offered to disable the item requirement.

It works best if the server and client both have the mod, but it also works if
only the client has it or only the server has it.
